# Lung Cancer Detection through Air Pollution using Machine Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project explores the relationship between **air pollution levels** and **lung cancer cases** using machine learning models. By analyzing environmental factors, the system predicts potential lung cancer risks, aiming to support early diagnosis and raise public health awareness.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning of air pollution & cancer datasets  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key patterns  
- Model training using machine learning algorithms  
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
- Visual insights into pollutionâ€“cancer correlations  

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**  
- **Scikit-learn**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset includes air quality parameters and cancer patient data.  
> *Source: Provided dataset in this repository (for educational use only).*

## ðŸ“Š Workflow
1. Import & preprocess the dataset  
2. Conduct exploratory data analysis  
3. Train and evaluate predictive models  
4. Visualize results and key findings  

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
The final model achieved promising accuracy, demonstrating a significant link between certain air pollutants and lung cancer prevalence.
